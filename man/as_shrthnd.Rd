\title{Coerce a shrthnd_num to a character vector with shorthand}
\usage{
as_shrthnd(x, digits = TRUE, .pillar = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{\link[=shrthnd_num]{shrthnd_num()}} vector}

\item{digits}{Whether to apply digit formatting}

\item{.pillar}{A flag for formatting within the \code{{pillar}} package}
}
\value{
A character vector
}
\description{
\code{as_shrthnd()} coerces a \code{shrthnd_num()} vector back to a character vector
re-inserting the shorthand tags.
}
\details{
When calling \code{as.character()} on a \code{shrthnd_num()} the output is as you
would expect when calling it on a traditional numeric vector, \code{as_shrthnd()}
returns a character vector combining the numeric vector and the shorthand
tags.

\examples{
x <- c("12", "34.567", "[c]", "NA", "56.78[e]", "78.9", "90.123[e]")
sh_x <- shrthnd_num(x, c("[c]", "[e]"), digits = 1)
as_shrthnd(sh_x)
as_shrthnd(sh_x, digits = FALSE)
}
