Data is often published with shorthand and symbols, and regularly these tags
are found in the same container as the value. The aim of `{shrthnd}` is to
process character vectors of numerical data that contain non-numeric shorthand
and symbols.

The most common approach in data processing is to scrub the vector of
non-numeric characters so that it can be coerced to a numeric vector. However,
these tags often convey useful information which you may wish to retain. The
`shrthnd_num()` data type builds on
[`vctrs::new_rcrd()`](https://vctrs.r-lib.org/reference/new_rcrd.html) to
separate the numeric and non-numeric components while keeping them attached to
each other. This means that you can perform numeric operations on the numeric
aspects of the vector while retaining the shorthand and symbols associated with
the base data.

In addition to tags within spreadsheet and table columns, other annotation
information might be included within the sheet/table such as in header or
footer rows. `{shrthnd}` also provides methods for processing these
annotations, or to add your own annotations to an R data frame.

## Installation

You can install the development version of shrthnd like so:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mattkerlogue/shrthnd")
```

## Usage

Use `shrthnd_num()` to convert a character vector to a `shrthnd_num` vector,
either a `shrthnd_integer` or a `shrthnd_double` based on the properties of
the underlying numerical content. This is a `vctrs::vec_rcrd()` data type that
splits the numeric content and non-numeric tags of the original character
vector but keeps them together rather than discards them.

```{r}
library(shrthnd)

x <- c("12", "34.567", "[c]", "NA", "56.78 [e]", "78.9", "90.123[e]", 
       "321.09*", "987.564 \u2021", ".", "..")

sh_x <- shrthnd_num(x)

sh_x

shrthnd_list(sh_x)

tbl <- tibble::tibble(
  x = x,
  sh_x = sh_x,
  as_num = as.numeric(sh_x), 
  as_char = as.character(sh_x),
  tag = shrthnd_tags(sh_x), 
  as_shrthnd = as_shrthnd(sh_x), 
  as_shrthnd2 = as_shrthnd(sh_x, digits = 3)
)

tbl

sh_tbl <- shrthnd_tbl(
  tbl,
  title = "Example table",
  notes = c("Note 1", "Note 2"),
  source_note = "Shrthnd documentation, 2023"
)

sh_tbl

annotations(sh_tbl)
```


## Logo

The `{shrthnd}` package logo is a combination of the word "shorthand" written
in [Pitman shorthand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitman_shorthand) alongside
an asterisk. The image was drawn by hand with plot points then adjusted for
plotting in `{ggplot2}`. The "shorthand" shape is based on the representation
in Arthur Reynold's *Pitman's English and Shorthand Dictionary*, retrieved from the
[Internet Archive on 2023-05-11](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.449114/page/n641/mode/1up).
